            "body": "If you are playing with your band and you play a wrong note, don\u0026rsquo;t freeze but play on. Act as if nothing happened. The listener will think that the note is part of the arrangement, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even notice and will keep dancing to the beat. When on the other hand you, or worse, the whole band stops playing, the listener will notice. They will wonder what happened. The train has stopped. When DJ\u0026rsquo;ing you follow the same principle. As the Disk Jockey you provide the music, and you glue song after song. Traditionally it is the best practice to be as subtle as possible. To create an endless stream of songs. One transforms into the other, without hiccup. The DJ thus always prelistens the next song in their headphone, to see if it fits. The next song has to have the same tempo, the same bpm (beats per minute) as the current song. Or the tempo of the next song has to be dividable by the previous song.\nSong A (beats per minute, time signature) Song B (beats per minute, time signature) Song A (120 bpm, 4/4) Song B (120 bpm, 4/4) Song C (160 bpm, 8/4) Song D (80 bpm, 4/4) Song E (70 bpm, 2/4) Song F (105 bpm, 6/4) If the next song differs slightly from the mould, you can adjust it with the pitchfaders. A higher pitch means a higher tempo. So if you have to speed up a song to match the previous song, the pitch gets higher. The tones and harmonies change and sometimes it even becomes a completely different song. Most turntables have common sense. They are only capable of changing the pitch to 8, 10 or 12 %.\nDJ Screw\nOften the DJ makes mistakes, as it is a very technical and precise process. When you mix two different songs, a slight tempo discrepancy is very noticable. But like with the band from earlier, you have to keep going. Sometimes you have to force a song out. Then it might sound fucking hostile.1\nFucking Hostile - Lenny Dee (1993)\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

If you say something, it passes through your lips; so, if you say \u0026ldquo;chariot\u0026rdquo;, a chariot passes through your lips.[^ Gilles Deleuze, The Logic of Sense (1969), p.22] Initialy it seems comfortable to remain in silence.

Which are created by frictions. And frictions are created by movement. As long as there is movement, there will be sound. silence would mean no seasons, not coming out of bed, procrastonating on writing.\nOften silence is even shouted. The loud shush of the librarian. I always go to the ‘KB’ (the royal library) to read. At the end of the hallway is the silent zone. It is not allowed to sit there with your computer, to prevent the sound of keyboards. I always went there. One of those days I put my hand on my ear, I was reading the french philosopher with the long and poetic sentences. My ear suddenly registered sound, it was the blood rushing through. It reminded me of the sea, and I thought I finally understood the text that was in front of me.\n"

He settled in a small village, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, and started his romantic artist existence. His artist name was TAMO. We visited him once a year at least. Those visits, seeing the good life and the turquoise sea, always impressed me and I looked up to him.\nWhen I was reading through my sources I encountered a lot that was familiar, and I often related the theories I was reading to the story of my grandfather. During the research process he was like a dog that I ran into multiple times during an aimless walk through the city where you afterwards realise that you saw the same dog twice This Graduation Research Paper not only serves to justify my own artist motives but is also a testimony to my dear grandfather, who was an inspiring figure to me and my family.\nWhen I was reading the concluding chapter of What’s the Use by Sara Ahmed, it was tempting to directly relate her story to that of my grandfather. She talks about leaving the nuclear family behind and starting your own queer family. And how queerness can be perceived as vandalism. How leaving behind can be perceived as destroying. A few family members of mine did indeed perceive the sudden escape of my grandfather as destructive. But when my mother tells about this story, she speaks with love and understanding, despite that she had to deal with the mess he left behind. I asked her if it would be far stretched to put my grandfather in this queer frame.\nbut at the same time noted that he was also conservative in many ways. It was a difficult time for men to be open and talk about emotions. And he didn\u0026rsquo;t. He married.\n"
