<p>To start with use:</p>
<p>The initial use of this Graduation Research Paper was to justify the misuse of instruments, by collecting and researching a framework of musicians, artists and theorists who rely on this methodology. The motivation for this research topic was that paradoxically as a maker I wasn’t completely at ease with making, where making meant building and constructing. The maker as an architect of meaning.
In my experience at the art school the teacher asks the student in the first year what the story is that they want to tell. The underlying expectation of this question is for the student to be dogmatic or ultimately become so by exhibiting an ultimate statement with a graduation work. To propagate a version of sense.
I could never relate the notions of story telling and sense making directly to my practice, as my turn to art making was initially a subversive one instead of constructive. I wanted to make art because I did not want to make use.
In a positivist society non-sense is perceived as vandalism.
But in this paper I want to make the argument that non-sense is not opposed to sense but rather that sense is a function of non-sense. With the generous help of the books <em>What’s the Use</em> by Sara Ahmed and <em>The Logic of Sense</em> by Gilles Deleuze and the beats by J Dilla. Both Ahmed and Deleuze make a plea for <a href="./keywords/pervert">the pervert</a> in their concluding chapters, as an alternative archetype.</p>
<p>Initially an egoistic quest, walking through streets of music and texts with no particular destination, I kept running into a dog who appeared in the space between sentences and beats.
I only recognised this dog later as my grandfather.
Therefore I want to dedicate this paper to TAMO.</p>
<p>My grandfather, inventor and escapis</p>
<p>By researching musicians, artists and theorists who misuse</p>
<p>We have a positivistic tendency to think in a frame of use and misuse is therein perceived as destructive. I felt intuitively from my experience in making that this approach does not stem from nihilism or absurdism
All the references in this book have in common that</p>
<p>With misuse I don’t mean misappropriate</p>
