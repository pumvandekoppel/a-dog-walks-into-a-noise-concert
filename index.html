<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>To start with use:
The initial purpose of this Graduation Research Paper was to justify misuse. Misuse in this paper means the improper handling of cutlery, instruments, computers, language and chess pieces. The misuse differs from the originally intended function and designed method of use of material. By collecting examples and samples I hope to create a framework of musicians, artists and theorists who rely on this methodology to then discover common ground. My interest in this topic stems from my taste in music, where there is always an underlying subversive layer, like a <a href="./808.md">808</a> bass tone. Music, <em>my first love</em> and its history, thus play an important role in my research and a theory of sound will frequently come through. Free of scientific conditions and formal obligations besides the word count, I also took the opportunity to incorporate my fascination for mathematics and for its shortcomings as well, where its perpendicular grid will allow to zoom in on the residues of the <a href="./modulus.md">modulus</a>. In short: I will make a point out of how some numbers, like pi, don't really fit in our number system and therefore have an endless tail, which in the case of pi we often cut off to 3.14. I will use these mathematical cases to illustrate how we tend to think in rigid structures to make sense of the world while there are always parts that don't fit into it.
Our protagonist is a dog. A dog who walked from / away and is now roaming through the city. It is lost in a skeleton of streets, wandering through the common grounds of misuse.
I got to know this dog during a short walk, I had no particular destination except an empty head. As I walked in rectangles and crossed streets I passed cars. I walked past neighbours, along the side of a football field with an angry coach and walked around furniture awaiting a new life on the sidewalk, but I kept crossing paths with this dog. It seemed to take a similarly aimless route. Only later, when I fell back into my office chair, I recognized this dog as my grandfather.
During the walk I was mainly reading <em>What's the Use</em> by Sara Ahmed and <em>The Logic of Sense</em> by Gilles Deleuze and listening to the beats of <a href="./J-Dilla.md">J Dilla</a> or radio <a href="file:///var/mobile/Library/Mobile%20Documents/27N4MQEA55~pro~writer/Documents/Graduation%20Research%20Paper/noise.md">noise</a>.
Both Ahmed and Deleuze make a plea for the <a href="./pervert.md">pervert</a> in the key chapters of their books.
To make a bridge with the metaphorical city, with its traffic noise and concert cafes, I refer to our protagonist pervert as a dog. Furthermore I will try to combine a theory of sound with the irrational number set <a href="./R/Q.md">R/Q</a> by substituting the absurd with the notion of <a href="file:///var/mobile/Library/Mobile%20Documents/27N4MQEA55~pro~writer/Documents/Graduation%20Research%20Paper/noise.md">noise</a>.
Initially an egoistic queste to defend my own vandalistic tendencies as an artist and person, I tripped over a lot of interesting topics, books and music, and of course this dog, the pervert, the inventor, the escapist, my dear grandfather, who led me together with a new family of sources onto a new view on my family history, seen from the shore, where we ended up a few hours later. The noise of the waves crashing down was deafening and provided no room to think, but we danced.</p>
